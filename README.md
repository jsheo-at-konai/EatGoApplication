### Web Project
The following is the reference data used during `.\eatgo-web\npm init`

<pre>
.\eatgo-web> npm init

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (eatgo-web)
version: (1.0.0)
description: Eat Go Web Project
entry point: (index.js) src/index.js
test command: jest
git repository:
keywords:
author: fastcampus
license: (ISC)
About to write to .\eatgo-web\package.json:

{
  "name": "eatgo-web",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Eat Go Web Project",
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "author": "fastcampus",
  "license": "ISC"
}


Is this OK? (yes)
</pre>

### Webpack Dev Server
To install `webpack-dev-server`, use the following command.
<pre>
./eatgo-web>npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
</pre>

There is an issue to start up `webpack-dev-server`.
It depends on the version of `webpack-cli`.
To resolve this, Use the appropriate command according to the version in `./eatgo-wep/package.json`.

For webpack-cli 3.x:
<pre>
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack-dev-server"
} 
</pre>

For webpack-cli 4.x:
<pre>
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack serve"
} 
</pre>
